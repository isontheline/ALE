ALE To-do list
==============

This file includes a tentative list of future versions and features.

0.8.5 (pre-Beta)
----------------

Note: This release may be combined with the 0.9.0 Beta release.

+ Modify help text and messages containing references to the old build process.
+ Move user and tech documentation from the website to this tree, and license
  under GPL, where 'object code' is understood to mean 'any non-source version
  of the work', as defined in GPLv3 draft 2.  Conversion from HTML to a more
  flexible format, such as texinfo or docbook, would be desirable.  Revision of
  the user manual for new features and syntax would be desirable.  Automatic
  inclusion of the text of README, TODO, and other package documentation would
  probably also be desirable.
  - Document new scoping operators {}, [], and [<>].
  - Document other changes in UI, including regularization of syntax.
+ Website updates to support README URL changes.


0.9.0 (Beta)
------------

+ Add Irani-Peleg processing to 3D output options.
  - Add generic 2D transformation class, supporting partial transformations.
+ Add multi-threading (e.g., in rendering code).
+ Add file-scoped options for black level, alignment type, etc.


1.0.0 (Stable)
--------------

+ Refine rendering and alignment code for better performance.
+ Internationalize command-line interface and help text to accommodate
  translations.
+ Update the Technical Manual for information regarding 3D operation.


Unsorted
--------

+ Review command-line interface and help text for suitability for translation
  to languages other than English.
+ Add facilities for manipulating images storing color as integer-valued data,
  possibly as library routines.
+ Move image-processing routines into a library that can be used by other 
  programs.
+ Add bindings for other programming languages.
