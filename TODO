ALE To-do list
==============

This list is dynamic, and may have changed since the last release.  For
updates, please see the version in the main repository.[1]


0.8.5 pre-beta (tentative)
--------------------------

+ Move user and tech documentation from the website to this tree, and license
  under GPL, where 'object code' is understood to mean 'any non-source version of
  the work', as defined in GPLv3 draft 2.  Conversion from HTML to a more flexible
  format, such as texinfo, would be desirable.  Revision of the user manual for
  new features and syntax would be desirable.
  - Document new scoping operators {}, [], and [<>].
  - Document other changes in UI, including regularization of syntax.

Note: This release may be merged with the 0.9.0 Beta release.


0.9.0 Beta
----------

+ Add Irani-Peleg processing to 3D output options.
  - Add generic 2D transformation class, supporting partial transformations.
+ Add multi-threading. 
+ Add file-scoped options for black level, alignment type, etc.


Unsorted
--------

+ Review command-line interface and help text for suitability for translation
  to languages other than English.

  translation.
