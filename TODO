ALE To-do list
==============

This file includes a tentative list of future versions and features.

0.8.5 (pre-Beta)
----------------

Note: This release may be combined with the 0.9.0 Beta release.

+ Documentation
  - Modify page footers to reflect the current license terms (doc/COPYING).
  - Consolidate the manual into a single work.
  - Add license section to the manual.
  - Convert from HTML to a more flexible format, such as texinfo or docbook.
  - Revise the user manual for new features and syntax.
  - Integrate source package documentation files README, TODO, etc. as links
    and table-of-contents entries.
  - Integrate source package documentation files README, TODO, etc., so that
    these text files are automatically generated from markup.  (?)
  - Document new scoping operators {}, [], and [<>].
  - Document other changes in UI, including regularization of syntax.
    * commas can no longer appear in single-argument options when using
      assignment-delimited syntax; use space-delimited syntax instead.
  - Update bootstrap and/or Makefile.am to properly build and install
    documentation.
+ Ensure consistency between the website hierarchy and the README.
+ Investigate options for creating and distributing a Windows package
  containing sufficient software to ensure support for common image types
  (perhaps statically linking with libraries for opening JPEG and PNG files).
  One option would be to use BitTorrent for distribution; another would be to
  distribute CDs.
+ Investigate options for distributing a complete package, including revision
  history, and, possibly, example image sets.  Bittorrent and CD seem the most
  obvious candidates for this.


0.9.0 (Beta)
------------

+ Add a generic 2D transformation class, supporting partial transformations.
+ Add a partial 2D transformation class with constructor taking a 3D
  transformation and 3D model as arguments.
+ Add file-scoped options
  - Irani-Peleg
  - black level
  - alignment type
  - focus details
+ Add Irani-Peleg processing for output from 3D models.
  - modify existing Irani-Peleg code to use generic partial 2D transformations.
+ Add facilities for handling depth-of-field and focus bracketing, as suggested
  by Viktors Rotanovs and Gregory Maxwell.
  - use user-provided (file-scoped) focus details to determine depth of field
  - use the 3D model for depth data, as suggested by Gregory Maxwell
  - use variable PSF to handle focus of input images in the Irani-Peleg
    algorithm, as suggested by Gregory Maxwell
+ Add multi-threading (e.g., in rendering code).


1.0.0 (Stable)
--------------

+ Refine rendering and alignment code for better performance.
+ Internationalize command-line interface and help text to accommodate
  translations.
+ Update the Technical Manual for information regarding 3D operation.


Unsorted
--------

+ Review command-line interface and help text for suitability for translation
  to languages other than English.
+ Add facilities for manipulating images storing color as integer-valued data,
  possibly as library routines.
+ Move image-processing routines into a library that can be used by other 
  programs.
+ Add bindings for other programming languages.
