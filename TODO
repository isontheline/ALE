--------------

Note: This release may be combined with the 0.9.0 Beta release.

+ Modify help text and messages containing references to the old build process.

  under GPL, where 'object code' is understood to mean 'any non-source version of
  the work', as defined in GPLv3 draft 2.  Conversion from HTML to a more flexible
  format, such as texinfo, would be desirable.  Revision of the user manual for
  new features and syntax would be desirable.
  - Document new scoping operators {}, [], and [<>].

Unsorted
--------

+ Review command-line interface and help text for suitability for translation
  to languages other than English.
+ Internationalize command-line interface and help text to allow 
  translation.
+ Update the Technical Manual for information regarding 3D operation.
