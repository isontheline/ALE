ALE is the Anti-Lamenessing Engine

This is a program designed to produce relatively alias-free images from digital
camera samples.  Much of it could be applied to images from any source, as long
as they are in PPM binary format.  

Downloading a binary
--------------------

	Windows
	-------

	Download ale-x_x_x-win32.zip, unzip, and execute ale.exe.  Note that 
	ALE takes arguments on the command line, so you may need to open a 
	command prompt window to use ALE successfully.  Typing 'ale.exe' with 
	no arguments will print a usage message.

	
	Other Platforms
	---------------

	No binaries provided.  Compile from source.


Compiling from source
---------------------

You will need GCC and a make utility (GNU Make will do fine).  To compile from
source, download the tarball into a directory, expand it with 'tar xzf
ale-x.x.x.tar.gz', enter the unzipped directory, and type 'make'.  The makefile
may need some tweaking on Windows systems (e.g. you may want to write the output
to 'ale.exe' or something.


Using ALE
---------

Usage: ale [--scale2] [--scale4] [--scale8] <input-files> ... <output-file>

This program clips several supplemental frames against an original frame and
merges the results into a single output file result.  The first input file is
considered the original frame, and subsequent input files are considered
supplemental frames.  All files must be in PPM binary (as opposed to ascii)
format.  The merge is produced incrementally, and you can inspect the output
file as the process progresses.  If a scaling argument is given, the program
will internally scale all input frames up by 2, 4, or 8, respectively,
resulting in an output file of this larger scale.
