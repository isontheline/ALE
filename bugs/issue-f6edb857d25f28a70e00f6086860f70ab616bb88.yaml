title: Limited multi-pass registration
desc: |-
  Consider that, as a special case of the general multi-pass approach to
  registration suggested (e.g., in current TODO), multiple passes might be
  performed for positions of early images in a sequence (or perhaps early images
  in a subsequence over a particular image region).
