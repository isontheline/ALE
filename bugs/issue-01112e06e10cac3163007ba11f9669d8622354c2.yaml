title: Eliminate bash dependency in ale script
desc: |-
  The ale script currently depends on bashism '-a' to pass through the invocation
  name, and so currently invokes bash to achieve this.  Some other method should
  probably be found for doing this.

    Note that the invocation name could probably be passed as an environment variable,
    so that the -a option to exec is not needed.
