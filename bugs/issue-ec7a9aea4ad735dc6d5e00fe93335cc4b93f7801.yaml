title: Serious memory leak affecting all current versions.
desc: |-
  Jari Juslin reports in message '[ale] Processing color negative scans with ALE'
  an apparent out-of-memory condition affecting 0.9 branch with --ips 0.  Testing
  with 0.8.11.1 indicates that the 0.8 branch is affected also.  In particular,
  the following commands result in memory increase without bounds (e.g., visible
  in top or atop) throughout execution, which is unexpected for this
  configuration:
  
  $ convert -size 1000x1000 xc:gray gray.png
  $ ale-bin --cache 0 --no-inc --dchain zero --achain zero --perturb-upper=0 --ips 0 `for i in \`seq 1 1000\`; do echo -n "gray.png "; done` null:
  
  (Ignore the segfault following execution; this is a consequence of the 'zero'
  filter.)
  
  Running 'valgrind' on an input set of smaller dimensions and frame count reveals
  a number of memory leaks (reachable and unreachable) which have now been fixed.
