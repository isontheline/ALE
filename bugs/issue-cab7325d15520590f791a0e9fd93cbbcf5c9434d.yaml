    Consider that a qualifier (e.g., -) might be added as a suffix to --ev added by
    the wrapper script, so that these can be ignored in certain circumstances
    (e.g., by default for initial exposure settings, or for exposure settings under
    a new --exp-user-meta, or so, option).
    
    As another possibility, if OpenCL-enabled alignment is sufficiently fast,
    alignments beginning with specified EV might by default be accompanied by
    alignment with automatic EV, with final alignment determined by match
    values after the final exposure adjustment occurs.

    Consider that it might be useful to distinguish between default alignments and
    non-default (as is done for --gs default), so that the former might rely on
    wrapper-derived --ev by default for the default alignment case, but not for
    alignments loaded from a file.
