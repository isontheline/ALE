title: Select or recommend how to select -march and -mtune for GCC
desc: |-
  GCC supports a variety of -march and -mtune options (see `info gcc`); it might be
  worthwhile to test these on relevant platforms and perhaps either set reasonable
  defaults or recommend such for users, if typical GCC defaults are not adequate.

    Perhaps most notable are -march=native and -mtune=native, which are said to
    select something reasonably optimal for the machine on which the compiler is
    being run.  From GCC documentation, the options appear support a rather broad
    range of x86 subtypes and instruction set features, so the native options 
    might be a good start.
    
    Other notable options would include `-mfpmath=see and -mfpmath=sse,387 .

    Note that use of SSE or so was brought up on either mailing list or e-mail some
    time ago, so it would probably be appropriate to look through the archives for
    a reference when publishing results (if any) to the mailing list (if I recall,
    no tests were mentioned, however).  Variation between 32- and 64-bit might also
    be worth looking at, as this has also been a topic of discussion on the list,
    and as the register architecture has changed for the larger, if I recall
    correctly (see Wikipedia for SSE, etc.; see also recent Libale bugs discussing
    acceleration issues).
