    For status output of (e.g., --bayer auto), consider:
    
     '002.png (RGB )'*** okay (84.073183% match).
     '003.png (rgbg)'*** okay (90.266200% match).
     '004.png (gbgr)'*** okay (78.123316% match).

    Consider that, for detecting grayscale uninterpolated bayer patterns (e.g.,
    those produced by dcraw -d/-D), it could be worthwhile to check for apparent
    similarity within planes of candidate bayer patterns, when compared against
    similarity in the grayscale image generally.  Such checks would, assumedly, be
    performed solely on images found to be grayscale (e.g., images having all
    channels equal for each pixel, if no other indicator of grayness is available).
    
    For distinguishing R/B, the commonest type for the given orientation might be
    chosen if no other marker is available (e.g., RGBG in the upright horizontal
    orientation is probably more common than BGRG).
