title: Integrate with and migrate algorithms to libale.

  Core algorithms should probably be moved to the libale project, which has a
  repository stored here:

    Integration with Libale may involve changing certain interfaces (e.g., image,
    render, etc.) to more closely resemble their Libale counterparts.  (E.g., image
    should no longer allow pixel access, and render should accept something like
    a sequence of (transformation, image) pairs.)

    Consider that, better than changing existing interfaces of image, render, etc.,
    would be to replace instances of these classes with instances of their libale
    counterparts, which approach would have the desirable side effect of
    immediately using the modified and up-to-date interfaces within libale.
