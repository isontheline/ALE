title: Consider revising re-filtering operation for more natural handling of low-certainty points
desc: |-
  In particular, when combining images of varying exposure, points having low
  certainty (e.g., as a consequence of the exposure of the image) should probably
  be dropped from refiltering, in favor of surrounding points.

    Consider that such a modified re-filtering step, or something similar, might
    also be applied following Irani-Peleg adjustments, so that results reflecting
    points having low certainty might be discarded in favor of a filtered result
    from surrounding points.

    Note that, in any treatment of varying-exposure images in Irani-Peleg code,
    it might be best to work on the certainty handling within the code (e.g.,
    one-sided certainty and such) rather than applying any filter after the
    run is complete.
