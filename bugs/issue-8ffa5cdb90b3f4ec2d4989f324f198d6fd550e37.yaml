    Consider that the bootstrap script might be modified to inject a variety of
    package variables, including mailing list, home page, and package name; that
    these might be built into the executable (and displayed with --version); and
    that they might perhaps be stored within the VERSION file if any storage is
    necessary for package configuration or re-configuration, or perhaps within
    appropriately named package files (e.g., MAILING-LIST, PACKAGE-NAME, etc.).
    
    Note that asciidoc attribute entries might be used as a means of embedding the
    variables into package documentation.

  - Modified VERSION to store variables as asciidoc-style attribute entries.
