  - One approach that may be worth investigating is compression (e.g., by PNG).

    One approach to solving this would be restricting the candidate set size
    for each pixel in the map, so that, e.g., only regions neighboring a local
    region (allowing any level of decomposition) can be mapped.

    Note that the int -> short patch was accidentally committed prior to 0.9.0.3,
    and was included in that version.  This patch has since been reverted.
