title: Revise incremental chain parser to accept more invariants, following likely updates to libale.
desc: |-
  A greater variety of invariants would probably be useful, perhaps facilitated by increased independence
  of invariant flags in Libale.  New styles might include such things as avgl (average last), avga (average about),
  medianf, medianl, mediana, etc.

    Note also that it may be desirable to have Irani-Peleg rendering mirror the invariant
    type of the underlying renderer, as suggested by the current API of Libale, as this
    would avoid the need to duplicate configuration information across the two types of
    rendering.
