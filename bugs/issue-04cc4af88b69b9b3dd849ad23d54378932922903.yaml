title: Revise incremental chain parser to accept more invariants, following likely updates to libale.
desc: |-
  A greater variety of invariants would probably be useful, perhaps facilitated by increased independence
  of invariant flags in Libale.  New styles might include such things as avgl (average last), avga (average about),
  medianf, medianl, mediana, etc.
