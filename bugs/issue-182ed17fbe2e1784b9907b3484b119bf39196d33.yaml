    Another possible approach to combination with certainty over regions might be
    to discard elements (or indeed images) having match indicating that they are
    outliers (whether due to lack of focus or otherwise).  Consider further that,
    if certainty weighting by frequency characteristics over a region is determined
    by such characteristics measured without registration of exposure, then the
    added noise at low (or clipping at high) exposure should not present a
    significant factor of confusion.
