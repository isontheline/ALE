  Holroyd


0.8.0 2005-Jan-12

alignment precision for large images, and reduces certainty-related noise
amplification in the Irani-Peleg renderer.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:

blurb)

Mailing list announcement:

+ Revise the 3D scene reconstruction algorithm

This release includes a revised summary:

ALE is an image-processing program used for tasks such as
super-resolution, deblurring, noise reduction, and anti-aliasing. Its
principle of operation is synthetic capture, combining multiple inputs
representing the same scene.


0.7.2 2004-Oct-26
-----------------

This release fixes exclusion region and alignment bugs, adds device support for
the Canon 300D SLR, and incorporates an experimental framework for
reconstruction of 3D scenes.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Incorporate changes from 0.7.1 patches
+ Add a device configuration for the Canon EOS 300D (Digital Rebel)
+ Incorporate an approach to 3D reconstruction.  (Does not work yet.)


0.7.1-patch2 2004-Sep-15
------------------------

Changelog summary:
+ Adds an option for establishing a minimum overlap area for global searches
+ Adds a rudimentary test suite.


0.7.1-patch1 2004-Sep-07
------------------------

Mailing list announcement:
+ Allows each perturbation bound to be specified as a percentage of the
  smallest image dimension (useful for large images?).
+ Fixes bugs in exclusion region handlers.
+ Fixes bugs in alignment failure handlers.
+ Avoids superfluously large undefined regions.
+ Adds experimental options for refining perturbation.


0.7.1 2004-Aug-27
-----------------

This release fixes alignment bugs, adds a global search option, and adds
support for the OmniView OV7620 sensor. (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Add linear PSF for OV7620
+ Add option to concatenate help pages
+ Fix VISP segfault
+ Incorporate changes from 0.7.0-patch1

Notes:
The default PSF for the OV7620 can be a bit noisy.  As an alternative,
box=1.3+box=1.8 also works well in some cases, and is less noisy.


0.7.0-patch1 2004-Aug-22
------------------------

Mailing list announcement:
+ Fixes alignment bugs.
+ Adds a global search option.
+ Adds support for ov7620 in raw, linear mode.

Notes:
The ov7620 device option expects that the 7620 be in raw, linear mode, and that
clamping be turned on.  These features may not be accessible using standard
drivers.


0.7.0 2004-Aug-06
-----------------

This release updates the renderer to support a variety of filters, including
sinc and Lanczos, and adds new options for excluding image regions and
processing video frames.  (Freshmeat blurb)


0.6.0 2004-Feb-10
-----------------

Merging and drizzling renderers now operate in linear colorspace, and the
Irani-Peleg renderer has been extended to handle convolutions in both linear
colorspace (e.g. lens blur) and non-linear colorspace (e.g. some types of
in-camera sharpening). New options in this release include certainty weighting
and exposure registration.  (Freshmeat blurb)


0.5.1 2003-Nov-19
-----------------

Changes in this release include optional support for 16-bit color channels and
built-in support for all PPM file types. Also, a user manual and an updated
technical description are now available.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)

[This release was, and remains (as of Sep 2006), the most advanced version
storing pixels as integer values (rather than as floating-point values).  As
integer values may be more suitable for certain applications, integer-valued
functions may be re-introduced, possibly as library code, in the future.
19-Sep-2006]

This release is accompanied by a revised summary:

ALE is a program that can render high-fidelity images of real
scenes by aligning and combining many similar images from a camera or
scanner. The correct similarity between images is roughly that achieved by
a somewhat unsteady hand holding a camera. 


0.5.0 2003-Nov-02
-----------------

Alignment following has been modified to support multiple-pass alignment of
panoramic image mosaics. Other changes in this release include code cleanup and
documentation updates.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.8 2003-Aug-01
-----------------

The Monte Carlo alignment algorithm has been modified, and may now offer better
alignment for small sample sizes. Also, the Irani-Peleg renderer now writes
output after each iteration when incremental output is enabled. Other changes
include a bugfix in Euclidean alignment, a new option for configuring the level
of detail, and a new independent constraint for rotational perturbation.
(Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.7 2003-Jul-27
-----------------

Support for device-specific projection functions and various bugfixes have been
added to the Irani-Peleg renderer. Also, a new option has been added that may
be useful for video stabilization applications.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.6 2003-Jul-01
-----------------

This release fixes bugs in drizzling and post-processing. The following
combinations should now work as expected: drizzling in combination with scaling
and Irani-Peleg image reconstruction in combination with high-frequency
enhancement.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.5 2003-Jun-23
-----------------

This release resolves a number of minor alignment bugs.  (Freshmeat blurb via
Neohapsis)


0.4.4 2003-Jun-06
-----------------

The PPM file handler has been updated to open files in binary mode, resolving a
serious bug under Windows. Also, the percentage of pixels used in Monte Carlo
alignment now more closely matches user specifications in typical cases.
(Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.3 2003-May-30
-----------------

A Monte Carlo alignment option has been added, which may reduce alignment time.
An option to disable incremental file output has also been added.  (Freshmeat
blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.2 2003-May-23
-----------------

An iterative image reconstruction renderer has been added, and the PPM file
handler has been updated to correctly handle PPM header comments.  (Freshmeat
blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.1 2003-Apr-28
-----------------

Increased spatial extents, drizzling, and new alignment options have been added
in this release.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.4.0p1 2003-Apr-04
-------------------

A bugfix from the Debian ALE package version 0.4.0-1 has been merged. Without
this fix, an assertion failure can occur when ImageMagick support is enabled.
(Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)

+ The original Debian fix was implemented by Debian package maintainer Nick
  Rusnov.


0.4.0 2003-Mar-30
-----------------

A general scaling option has been added, and the high-frequency enhancement
filter now works near image boundaries.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.3.2 2003-Mar-26
-----------------

A match summary was added to the program's output, comments in transformation
file output were made more helpful, and an experimental high-frequency
enhancement option was added.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.3.1 2003-Mar-25
-----------------

(This release appears to have been superseded by 0.3.2.)


0.3.0 2003-Jan-17
-----------------

New options in this release facilitate writing final alignment transformations
to a file, reading initial alignment transformations from a file, and setting
an upper boundary on the correction step size used in alignment.  (Freshmeat
blurb via Neohapsis)


0.2.0 2003-Jan-01
-----------------

General projective transformations can now be used in image alignment.
(Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.1.2 2002-Dec-13
-----------------

A new file handler has been added to read and write JPEG, PNG, and other image
formats using the ImageMagick C API. The default PPM-only file handler now
deals with certain file errors more gracefully.  (Freshmeat blurb via
Neohapsis)

+ Translation of file formats using ImageMagick was suggested by Nick Rusnov.


0.1.1 2002-Dec-09
-----------------

In this version, a scaling bug that caused corruption of boundary pixels has
been fixed. Also, the alignment algorithm has been modified to use reduced
detail for coarse alignment steps.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.1.0 2002-Nov-26
-----------------

The image alignment algorithm has been updated.  (Freshmeat blurb via Neohapsis)


0.0.0 2002-Oct-11
-----------------

Initial release 

Program Summary:

ALE aligns and merges several similar images from a digitizing device (such as
a digital camera or scanner) into a single image. This may have the effect of
producing a relatively alias-free image (sometimes called "anti-aliasing").
