Mailing list announcement:
+ Various enhancements to handling of 3D scenes.


0.8.2 2005-Nov-22

This release revises the 3D scene reconstruction algorithm, allowing more
robust handling of certain scenes. New 3D model and output options have also
been added, including support for clipping planes and arbitrary camera
positioning. This release also fixes certain bugs in 2D control-point
alignment.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Fix 2D control point alignment bugs
+ Revise 3D modeling code to use spatial subdivision and occupancy
+ Add support for clipping planes and arbitrary camera positioning


0.8.1 2005-May-6

This release adds control points, median-value rendering, and a unified 3D
scene model. It resolves certain syntax errors, allowing successful compilation
under GCC 3.4.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Add control points, median-value rendering, and a unified 3D scene model.
+ Resolve syntax errors causing compilation failure under GCC 3.4.


0.8.0-patch 2005-Apr-13

+ Patch to fix build failures under GCC 3.4 noted by Tom Holroyd and Gregory
  Maxwell


0.8.0 2005-Jan-12

This release adds a more informative TTY user interface, increases Euclidean
alignment precision for large images, and reduces certainty-related noise
amplification in the Irani-Peleg renderer.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Add a more informative TTY user interface
+ Increase Euclidean alignment precision for large images
+ Reduce certainty-related noise amplification in the Irani-Peleg renderer


0.7.3 2004-Dec-1

This release includes revised 3D algorithms, reduced memory usage for certain
rendering steps, and new point-spread function and device options.  (Freshmeat
blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Reduce memory usage in Irani-Peleg and 3D renderers
+ Add new PSF options for convolution and scalar multiplication
+ Revise the 3D scene reconstruction algorithm


0.7.2 2004-Oct-26

This release fixes exclusion region and alignment bugs, adds device support for
the Canon 300D SLR, and incorporates an experimental framework for
reconstruction of 3D scenes.  (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Incorporate changes from 0.7.1 patches
+ Add a device configuration for the Canon EOS 300D (Digital Rebel)
+ Incorporate an approach to 3D reconstruction.  (Does not work yet.)


0.7.1-patch2 2004-Sep-15

Changelog summary:
+ Adds an option for establishing a minimum overlap area for global searches
+ Adds a rudimentary test suite.


0.7.1-patch1 2004-Sep-07

Mailing list announcement:
+ Allows each perturbation bound to be specified as a percentage of the
  smallest image dimension (useful for large images?).
+ Fixes bugs in exclusion region handlers.
+ Fixes bugs in alignment failure handlers.
+ Avoids superfluously large undefined regions.
+ Adds experimental options for refining perturbation.


0.7.1 2004-Aug-27

This release fixes alignment bugs, adds a global search option, and adds
support for the OmniView OV7620 sensor. (Freshmeat blurb)

Mailing list announcement:
+ Add linear PSF for OV7620
+ Add option to concatenate help pages
+ Fix VISP segfault
+ Incorporate changes from 0.7.0-patch1

Notes:
The default PSF for the OV7620 can be a bit noisy.  As an alternative,
box=1.3+box=1.8 also works well in some cases, and is less noisy.


0.7.0-patch1 2004-Aug-22

Mailing list announcement:
+ Fixes alignment bugs.
+ Adds a global search option.
+ Adds support for ov7620 in raw, linear mode.

Notes:
The ov7620 device option expects that the 7620 be in raw, linear mode, and that
clamping be turned on.  These features may not be accessible using standard
drivers.


0.7.0 2004-Aug-06

This release updates the renderer to support a variety of filters, including
sinc and Lanczos, and adds new options for excluding image regions and
processing video frames.  (Freshmeat blurb)


0.6.0 2004-Feb-10

Merging and drizzling renderers now operate in linear colorspace, and the
Irani-Peleg renderer has been extended to handle convolutions in both linear
colorspace (e.g. lens blur) and non-linear colorspace (e.g. some types of
in-camera sharpening). New options in this release include certainty weighting
and exposure registration.  (Freshmeat blurb)
