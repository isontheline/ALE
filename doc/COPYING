This documentation subtree is licensed under exactly the same terms as the
program itself, with the addendum that the phrase 'object code', if not
otherwise defined, should be understood to mean 'any non-source version of the
work'.  (This definition is motivated by the definition of the term used in the
second draft of GPLv3.)
