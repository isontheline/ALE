<section><title>0.8.5 (pre-Beta)</title>

<edit by="David Hilvert" in-month="2006-Sep"/>

<note>This release may be combined with the 0.9.0 Beta release.</note>
<section>
<title>
  Documentation
</title>
  <ul>
  <li> Convert from HTML to a more flexible format, such as texinfo or docbook.
  </li><li>Add license information (GPL; see doc/COPYING) sections to the manuals.
  </li><li>Add additional permission for distribution of hardcopy documentation 
    with source downloadable from a public network server in the case of orders
    placed on-line.
  </li><li>Modify page footers to better reflect the updated license terms.
  </li><li>Consolidate the manuals into a single work (e.g., docbook set, texinfo
    top-node) for more straightforward searching and indexing.
  </li><li>Add a new 'package manual' including the text of source package
    documentation files README, TODO, etc., so that these are searchable
    using utilities such as GNU info.
  </li><li>Modify bootstrap script to generate plain-text package documentation
    (README, TODO, etc.) from markup. (?)
  </li><li>Centralize licensing and authorship information (e.g., there should be only
    one COPYING file and only one AUTHORS file).
  </li><li>Incorporate an automatic method for building the target documentation
    types.  The example Makefile supplied with docbook-xsl would be sufficient
    for this, but note that their license and copyright terms should be included
    as copyright notices in the AUTHORS and/or COPYING files (or equivalent).
  </li><li>Revise the user manual for new features and syntax.
    <ul>
    <li>Document new scoping operators {}, [], and [&lt;>].
    </li><li>Document other changes in UI, including regularization of syntax.
      <ul>
      <li>in particular, commas can no longer appear in single-argument options
        when using assignment-delimited syntax; use space-delimited syntax
        instead.  This behavior is inconsistent with 0.8.4.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li><li>Add a section to the README indicating how to obtain and update source via
    darcs.
  </li><li>Update bootstrap and/or Makefile.am to properly build and install
    documentation.  (Since the required tools might not be be available
    everywhere, building the documentation from the bootstrap file would
    probably be preferable.)
  </li><li>Add a tutorial, and credit Metin Toyran for suggesting a step-by-step
    guide.
  </li><li>Move generated doc files to subdirectories expressive of their format,
    in cases where more than one file is used to contain the documentation.
    (html, info, etc.)
  </li>
  </ul>

<section>
<title>
  Website
</title>
  <ul>
  <li> Ensure consistency between the website hierarchy and the README.</li>

  Packaging

  <section>
  <title>
    Complete Package
  </title>
<ul><li> Investigate options for distributing a 'complete' package including full
  revision history, pre-built documentation (if the ordinary distribution does
  not include this), and, possibly, example image sets.  Direct download,
  bittorrent and CD are the most prominent candidates for distribution.
  <ul>
  <li> In the case of CD distribution, information should probably be added to the
    manuals regarding how to update CD-provided program source.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  </section><section>
  <title>
    Windows Package
  </title>
<ul>
<li> Investigate options for creating and distributing a combined source and
  binary Windows package containing sufficient software to ensure support for
  common image types (e.g., by statically linking with libraries for opening
  JPEG and PNG files).  BitTorrent and CD are the most obvious candidates for
  distribution.
  <ul>
  <li> This package could build on the package described above, as a 'for Windows'
    variant or some such.
  </li><li> This package could make use of an application such as InstallJammer for
    installation.
  </li>
  </ul>

<title>
	0.9.0 (Beta)
</title>
<edit by="David Hilvert" in-month="2006-Sep"/>
<section>
<title>
	Abstract and partial transformations
</title>
<ul>
<li>Add a generic 2D transformation class, supporting partial transformations.
  <ul><li> 'partial transformation', as used here, means that it is expected that some
    points will fail to map.
  </li></ul>
</li><li> Add a partial 2D transformation class with constructor taking as arguments
  a pair of 3D projective transformations and a 3D model.
</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
<title>
	File scoping
</title>
<ul><li> Add new file-scoped options
  <ul><li> Irani-Peleg
  </li><li> black level
  </li><li> alignment type
  </li><li> focus details
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<title>
	Irani-Peleg for 3D models
</title>
<ul><li> Modify existing Irani-Peleg code to use generic (partial) 2D transformations.
  <ul><li> in combination with the above, this should allow the algorithm to operate
    on 3D models.
  </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<title>
	Focus bracketing for depth-of-field expansion
</title>
<ul><li> Add facilities for handling depth-of-field and focus bracketing in input
  image sets, as suggested by Viktors Rotanovs and Gregory Maxwell.  This
  change will likely involve:
  <ul><li> using the 3D model for depth data, as suggested by Gregory Maxwell
  </li><li> using user-provided (file-scoped) focus details to determine depth of field
  </li><li> using variable PSF in the Irani-Peleg algorithm, as suggested by Gregory
    Maxwell
  </li><li> developing an approach to handle the incremental (non-Irani-Peleg) case.
  </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<title>
	Multi-threading
</title>
<ul><li> Add multi-threading options (e.g., for rendering code), so that a single
  invocation of the program can run on multiple processors simultaneously.
</li></ul>
</section>
</section>



<section>
<title>
	1.0.0 (Stable)
</title>
<edit by="David Hilvert" in-month="2006-Sep"/>

<title>
	Performance
</title>
<ul><li> Refine rendering and alignment code for better performance.
  </li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<title>
	Internationalization
</title>
<ul><li> Enhance the command-line interface in preparation for i18n.  (?)
  <ul><li> e.g., syntax for identifying synchronized frame sets
  </li></ul>
</li><li> Internationalize the command-line interface and help text to accommodate
  translations.
  </li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<title>
	Technical Manual Updates

  possibly as library routines.
</li></ul>
</section>

<title>
	Library
</title>
<ul><li> Move image-processing routines into a library that can be used by other 
  programs.
