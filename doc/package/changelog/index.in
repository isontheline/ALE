	Mihai Varzaru as being broken in Ubuntu 8.10.

o	Update documentation makefile for better links compatibility.

V	0.9.0.1 2008-Jun-13

o	Use a pager (e.g., less) when displaying help.

o	Add a man page, at the recommendation of Debian developer Ruben Molina.
	The man page structure roughly follows that of Debian Iceweasel, GNU tar,
	and the earlier ALE manual page for Debian by Nick Rusnov and Ruben
	Molina.

o	Add new algorithms for pixel assignment in multi-alignment, including
	filling, least-size local selection, and global-best selection.

o	Fix various multi-alignment bugs, including a bug causing increased
	computational complexity for rendering, as well as offset and scaling
	bugs.

o	Modify --lod-max to --lod-preferred, add a dimension restriction
	--min-dimension on level-of-detail, and make --lod-preferred=-3
	and --min-dimension=10 default.

o	Revise DejaGNU test suite for current option syntax, so that "make
	check" now runs all tests.

o	Do not attempt to handle --trans-{save,load} arguments as images in
	the ale wrapper script.

o	Add include <string.h> to ui/ui.h in an attempt to resolve Debian bug
	#482765, reported by Marc Brockschmidt and noted by Ruben Molina.

o	Include more information about scale cluster structures in the
	logging ui.

o	Add tonal registration by element to multi-alignment code.

o	Add a minimum average certainty for registration of multi-alignment
	elements.

o	Modify ale script to tally thread statistics when the environment
	variable ALE_COUNT_THREADS is set non-zero.

V	0.9.0 2008-Apr-14

o	Add skeletal web documentation to the documentation tree, in doc/web,
	and revise this to consolidate more information on the front page.

o	Implement an alignment technique allowing multiple alignments for a
	single frame.  Handling parts of a frame separately to resolve
	alignment issues (but using match thresholding to discard regions
	instead of using multiple alignments) was suggested by Rob Stewart.

o	Add --resident parameter, allowing explicit allocation of backing store
	for (e.g., large) image data structures.

o	Check for NaN in linearization and unlinearization in exposure_default,
	as a possible fix for a segmentation fault reported by Bret Towe.

V	0.8.11 2007-Nov-03

o	Revise certain code for improved execution speed, including
	disabling certain assertions and reducing calls to pow().

o	Replace geometric-mean filtering of weight values with minimum-value
	filtering, reducing calls to pow().

o	Add fixed-point data types selectable at configuration time for
	coordinate and color data, hence improving speed on certain embedded
	platforms.  Use on phones was suggested by Wen Guihua.

o	Revise incremental rendering code to store color values unnormalized by
	weights.

o	Revise multi-alignment options for the currently-considered
	implementation.

o	Eliminate NaN propagation that could lead to alignment failure in
	certain cases, perhaps causing an alignment bug reported in earlier
	versions by Gregory Maxwell.

V	0.8.10.1 2007-Oct-04

o	Change 'char *' referencing string literals to 'const char *'.

o	Set perturbation multipliers to 1 in cases of a non-finite value.

V	0.8.10 2007-Oct-02

o	Add threading for d2::image::*scale_by_half() functions.

o	Always rescale transformations for full detail after alignment is
	complete.

o	Make --lod-max=-4 default.

o	Make default --dchain auto:triangle:2,fine:box:1,triangle:2, which
	should produce better output during re-filtering than the previous
	default.

o	Revise re-filtering operation to use as a filter scale the distance
	between nearest defined points in opposite axis-centered cones about
	the point to be filtered.

o	Update scale cluster structures and interpolation routines used in
	alignment for calculating and storing certainty and weights; in 
	particular, certainty of the input frame is now pre-calculated 
	for multiple levels of detail.

o	Add currently-unused skeletal code for non-linear level of detail
	calculations.

o	Revise Monte-carlo value to use a single static default, removing
	dynamic behavior and certain associated support code, and applying the
	sampling rate in a uniform manner to all levels of detail and all tonal
	and spatial registration algorithms.

o	Fix error in level-of-detail accounting in alignment code.

o	Replace references to math.h with references to ale_math.h.

V	0.8.9.1 2007-Aug-31

o	Attempt to resolve certain 'always true' warnings reported by
	Marius Schamschula on Mac OS 10.3.9 (PPC).

o	Add macros for isinf() and isnan() in an attempt to resolve build 
	failures reported by Marius Schamschula on Mac OS 10.3.9 (PPC).

o	Resolve certain build errors occuring when configuring
	--disable-threads, or when threads are unavailable.

o	Remove instrumentation writing to 'lsimulated.png'.

V	0.8.9 2007-Aug-25

o	Set new defaults for --ips, --dchain, and --3d-dchain, and remove --q*

o	Add rendering chain scaled sampling filter type auto:, implementing
	re-filtering, with rough automatic filter size determination.

o	Add an abstract domain decomposition threading class.

o	Revise Irani-Peleg code for reduced memory and cpu use.

o	Attempt to fix exclusion region handling after a bug report by 
	Gregory Maxwell; other issues may remain.

o	Fix handling of --ip-{mean,median}, resolving a bug noted by Gregory
	Maxwell.

o	Add wrapper script 'ale' for handling raw files and extracting Exif metadata.

o	Allow any match when the threshold specified is neither positive nor zero.

o	Update license to GPLv3.

o	Various rendering bugfixes.

V	0.8.8.1 2007-May-18

/build
o	Disable d2::gauss::cutoff definition after a build failure reported by
	Marius Schamschula on an Intel Mac running 10.4.9 (gcc 4.0.0?).

V	0.8.8 2007-May-15

o	Include an incomplete implementation for multiple alignment region handling.

o	Make --16bpc default.

o	Add extents calculation to d2::render::ipc to limit the area examined during 
	exposure re-estimation.

o	Provide a new cache of fixed size for input images, defaulting to 256MB, 
	adjustable via the --cache option.

o	Add error statistics for calculating center of rotation and perturbation size
	for alignment.

o	Add loop avoidance for dynamic monte carlo alignment.

o	Disable --follow in the non-default case when perturbation size is zero.

o	Make --no-inc default.

o	Add 'defaults' global search option, and make this option default.

o	Modify --gs-mo to allow specification as a percentage, and make 67%
	default.

o	Add user interface options --ui=log and --ui=quiet, with greater and
	lesser verbosity, respectively.

o	Modify black level handling to always use linear values.

o	Increase default barrel distortion multiplier and rate maximum to 2.0
	and 8.0, respectively.

o	Revise ordering of ui_tty status output so that more informative 
	fields occur earlier in the string.

o	Modify numerical formatting of certain UI elements to preserve
	constancy of field locations in typical cases.

o	Add Gaussian PSF.  (HJ Hornbeck)

o	Recalculate diff statistics after increasing the mc parameter in
	dynamic monte carlo alignment.

o	Update Nikon D50 PSF.  (HJ Hornbeck)

o	Add UI update thread, in cases where threads are available.

o	Allow file-scoped --gs and --gs-mo options.

o	Ignore fex regions for nex SSFEs, resolving a bug noted by Gregory
	Maxwell.

o	Add --black option for specifying black level as a fraction of
	saturation.

o	Add --ev option for specifying ISO100-equivalent EV.

o	Add breakdown of profiling information by perturbation size for local
	alignment.

V	0.8.7 2007-Mar-04

o	Add a weight-limiting option to the Irani-Peleg renderer.

o	Add incremental renderer mean invariant avgf:<x>:<e> weight-limited to
	initial values.

o	Modify d2::image::defined_scale_by_half() to use a geometric mean, so
	that alignment at reduced level of detail will still work at larger
	reductions when using non-zero certainty.

V	0.8.6 2007-Feb-17

o	In d2::align, use rotation about the frame center as an alternative
	in cases where the sampling centroid is undefined.

o	Modify d2::point::{neg,pos}inf() assertions to allow for isinf() 
	implementations returning any non-zero value for any infinity.

o	Re-adjust exposure in Irani-Peleg even when no non-linear stage is 
	present.

o	Adjust the default pixel definition threshold to account for the
	certainty floor.

o	Use a rudimentary, single-pass estimate-based certainty approach for
	incremental rendering.

o	When --cx is positive, use only certainty calculated from the simulated
	scene for estimating tonal registration in Irani-Peleg passes.

o	Remove --qr default setting, as certainty and range-extension now have
	established general defaults.

o	Change --cx to 1 by default.  Change --exp-extend to be disabled by
	default.  Remove these flags from default settings.

o	Update driver names to omit file type qualifiers, according to the
	convention used in HJ Hornbeck's Nikon D50 device configuration patch.

o	Add Nikon D50 device configuration.  (HJ Hornbeck)

o	Update default settings according to time and image quality test
	results.  fine:triangle:2, gauss:0.75, and combinations of these
	filters were suggested by HJ Hornbeck.

o	Revise incremental renderer to store unnormalized values, for better
	handling of small weights, and eliminate the minimum contribution weight.

o	Add inlining and pre-calculation to Irani-Peleg.  (HJ Hornbeck)

o	Add gaussian sampling filter.  (HJ Hornbeck)

V	0.8.5 2007-Jan-19

o	Remove binaries and documentation sections from the readme, and
	prune non-package documentation for source distributions.

o	Make the --follow alignment option default.

o	Add help text for argument scope.

o	Modify rotational alignment search to rotate about the centroid
	of the sample region.

o	Revert 3D code to experimental status due to poor handling of
	real image sets.

o	Modify 3D code for slightly better handling of real image sets.

V	0.8.5-pre3 2006-Nov-03

/alignment
o	Fix a potential nondeterminism bug due to undefined seed bits in the
	random number generator.  (Fixes certain alignment failures.)

/
o	Modify default settings using Irani-Peleg rendering to use the
	triangle:2 incremental rendering chain.

o	Add dynamic monte carlo alignment, and make this default.

o	Correct --exp-mult arg count.  (Gregory Maxwell)

o	Allow file-scoped use of --perturb-upper.

V	0.8.5-pre2 2006-Oct-25

o	Modify d2::image::scale() to correctly handle offsets for
	scale factors other than negative powers of two.

o	Reformat most help text to fit a 79 column screen.

o	Add option --profile to measure elapsed real time for 2D alignment
	and rendering operations.

o	Add support for POSIX threads to 2D alignment and rendering code.
	(Adding multithreading support was first suggested by Jody (Joe)
	Harris.  Testing of multithreaded code on multiprocessor hardware was
	done by Gregory Maxwell.)

V	0.8.5-pre1 2006-Oct-16

o	Incorporate all existing ALE documentation within the source
	tree, and license under GPL.  Begin migration of documentation,
	including package documentation files, to a more flexible format.

o	Modify ui_tty for correct operation under Hurd and DragonFly
	consoles.  

o	Revise README for autotools build and installation.

o	Add file 'TODO', containing a to-do list for future releases.

o	Add AUTHORS file, in accordance with the autotools packaging
	standards.

o	Revise Changelog name to autotools-approved ChangeLog

o	Add NEWS file containing mailing list and Freshmeat announcement text
	for versions through 0.8.4.  This file is required by autotools.

o	Add options --f{ex,crop} for frame-coordinate exclusion regions.

o	Add autotools-based configuration, build, and installation facilities,
	replacing the earlier Makefile-based configuration and build process.

o	Modify --mc to be a file-scoped option.

o	Modify command-line interface to accept certain scope operators, and
	to increase uniformity of syntax.

o	Move input interface details, including option handling, messages,
	and help information, to the ui/ subdirectory.

o	In d3::scene, always use filler spaces when --pc all is specified.

V	0.8.4 2006-May-14

o	Fix build error noted by Gregory Maxwell and re-tag version.

o	Add fine-grain UI updates for 3D operations when using ui=tty.  Reduce
	tty UI status update frequency to at most once per second.

o	Modify --3dpx to affect scene geometry rather than rendered
	pixels.  In certain cases, this change should allow removal of objects
	close to the camera, hence revealing objects further away.

o	Add to the Makefile a HASH_MAP option that can be used to assign the
	3D spatial info structure a hash map type instead of the standard STL
	map type.  As this is likely to break things, it is currently
	undocumented.  HASH_MAP=GNU seems to compile with g++ 4.0.x but
	has not otherwise been tested.

o	Add support for synthetic focus via the --focus option, including
	focus with horizontal and vertical tilt.  Adding simulated focus
	effects, including tilted and swung focal planes, was suggested by
	Gregory Maxwell.

o	Add support for filtering 3D output with --3d-filter.  This
	is now the default behavior.  Add an option --3d-chain for selecting
	the filter chain used for 3D output.  (See --hl and --hq for details.)

o	Fix dimension comparison bug in d3::space::traverse::get_next_split().

o	Implement an experimental approach to 3D subspace candidate selection;
	this seems to perform poorly in most cases due to parallax effects.
	See the source code for details.  (Option --subspace-traverse)

o	Add adaptive weight decomposition to 3D occupancy algorithms.

o	Move low-level code concerning scale and level-of-detail from
	d3::scene to d3::pt.

o	Move code concerning the nature of space from d3::scene to 
	d3::space.

o	Interpolate to generate smooth 3D depth output.

o	Remove older 3D rendering code. 

o	Add decimation options --di-upper, --di-lower, and --do-try for
	reducing the complexity of 3D scene geometry, hence reducing the
	number of operations required for occupancy updating.

o	Add a script 'transform' for applying an inverse projective
	transformation.  Recalculation of transformations was suggested by Rob
	Stewart (ALE mailing list message, 2005-Dec-28).

o	Add dates to the Changelog, using dates in comments in the download
	page on the website for versions prior to 0.8.0, and using dates from
	the darcs repository for versions 0.8.0 and later.


V	0.8.3 2005-Dec-23

o	Add option --3dpx to specify 3D regions to exclude during final
	rendering, using a single depth for each pixel in each frame of
	rendered output.  (Evaluates at the depth used in depth-rendering.)

o	Add option --pc to specify which pairwise comparisons should be
	performed.

o	Add --et option to specify encounter thresholds.

o	Clean up d3::scene to remove triangle-mesh code.

o	Add an option --def-nn to allow definition of pixels in output images
	to take values from neighboring pixels within a certain radius, in
	cases where they would not otherwise be defined.

o	Modify representation of 3D subspaces so that refined subspaces
	are roughly cubical, and to allow refinements at multiple
	resolutions.

o	Fix bugs in 3D color and occupancy updating caused by bounding
	box miscalculation.

o	Add option --pa to set the number of point candidates accepted
	for each pair of cameras (pairwise ambiguity).  The default
	of 3 preserves existing default behavior.

o	Add option --oui for determining occupancy update iterations.
	The new default is 10, halving the previous default of 20.

o	Add option --tcem for scoring point candidates by third-camera
	views.  The default of 0 preserves existing default behavior.


V	0.8.2 2005-Nov-22

o	Add magical file 'dump:' for listing color values numerically
	to stderr.

o	Transition from a subdivisible triangle model to a subdivisible	
	space model, using a rudimentary implementation of Hans Moravec's 
	notion of occupancy.

o	Add support for view and depth output from arbitrary cameras.

o	Add clipping plane options for 3D modeling.

o	Fix various bugs in control-point alignment reported by Gregory
	Maxwell.


V	0.8.1 2005-May-6

o	Modify --q1 to use median-value incremental rendering.

o	Add support for median-value incremental and Irani-Peleg rendering.
	Using a statistic other than the mean was suggested by Scott Scriven
	as a means of eliminating non-uniform artifacts.  Using the median
	seems to improve performance on Scott Scriven's example sequences, as
	well as on the scaled output of fine:sinc*lanc for sparse inputs.

o	Move ale-psf-calibrate to a new scripts directory.

o	Add support for using control points in 2D and 3D alignment, as well
	as in 3D model construction.  New options include '--gs points',
	'--cpf-load=', '--cpp-upper=', '--cpp-lower=', '--va-upper=', and
	'--st'.

o	Fix enumerator compile bugs noted by Gregory Maxwell and Tom Holroyd
	to cause compilation failure under GCC 3.4.

o	Add average magnitude comments to transformation data file output.

o	Add a color adjustment option --exp-mult=.

o	For 3D scene reconstruction, use a new unified surface model in place
	of the depth-based multi-model approach used in 0.8.0.  The new model
	is adjusted on the basis of edge, angle, and color measures.


V	0.8.0 2005-Jan-12

o	Add a flag --exp-meta-only which causes tonal registration to be
	performed only on the basis of exposure metadata (e.g., data encoded
	as EPPM extended attributes).  This approach was suggested by Gregory
	Maxwell.

o	Set image offsets in d2/render/combine.h.  This allows Irani-Peleg
	rendering to work with --crop when the default rendering chain
	includes more than one rendering invariant.

o	Perform Irani-Peleg updating separately by channel instead of
	using vector operations.  This allows divide-by-zero and other
	conditions to be localized to particular channels.

o	Modify the Irani-Peleg renderer to use estimate-based certainty.  This
	seems to improve noise characteristics significantly.

o	Write the results of tonal registration as a comment in the 
	transformation data file.

o	Add support for PPM with extended attributes (EPPM).  Attributes
	handled specially include black level, shutter speed, aperture, and
	ISO (or gain).

o	Add experimental cost calculation routines to d3/scene.h.

o	Modify euclidean alignment so that perturb-upper and perturb-lower
	apply to rotational arclength.

o	Fix an index variable bug in d2::image_bayer_ale_real::trigger().

o	Modify d2::exposure one-sided certainty so that the 'one-sided'
	condition only applies to bright (>50%) areas.  Applying it to dark
	areas has no clear benefit, and an experiment by Gregory Maxwell
	demonstrates that doing so can exacerbate noise.

o	Modify d2::align to use unscaled input images when the scale factor
	is larger than 1.0, or when a scaled_filter interpolant is being used.

o	Modify d2::image::scale() to allow scale factors in the interval 
	(0, 1), and modify the command-line interface and help text to reflect
	this change.  --scale= now accepts all finite positive values.

o	Add user interface options --ui=stream and --ui=tty.  The latter
	includes more detailed status output when terminal width information
	can be obtained (esp. when IOCTL=1 is set at compile time), and is the
	new default.

o	Move certain user interface elements to the source subdirectory ui/.

o	Modify d2::render::ipc::_ip_frame_correct() so that exposure
	re-estimation uses a ratio of weighted sums instead of a weighted
	average of ratios.

o	Modify d2::align::set_exposure_ratio() so that alignment 
	weights and certainty values are taken into consideration.  

o	Add a --cw option to weight alignment error by certainty values,
	as suggested by Gregory Maxwell.  This allows the contributions of
	pixels at maxval to be diminished, which can increase alignment
	success in certain cases.

o	Replace functions d2::incremental::{increase,decrease}_extents()
	with new functions that take exclusion regions into account.  The new
	functions should also fix a boundary-calculation bug reported by
	Gregory Maxwell.

o	Modify d2/render/ipc.h to handle exclusion regions more effectively.

o	Add --crop argument, which excludes the spatial complement of a
	specified area over a specified set of frames.  Gregory Maxwell notes
	several advantages of internal over external crops, including
	preserving knowledge of position in the uncropped frame, which among
	other benefits allows natural handling of Bayer patterns.

o	Modify rx_parameters in d2/render.h to use the ale_pos data type
	instead of int.  This should allow exclusion regions to be calculated
	more accurately.


V	0.7.3 2004-Dec-1

o	Add incremental 3D reconstruction output.

o	Remove the reference to a non-existent web page in
	unsupported::fornow().

o	Allow device-specific bayer patterns to be overridden by the --bayer
	option.

o	Add an option for explicitly setting the camera view angle.  Make the 
	default view angle 43.7 degrees.

o	Implement optimizations that reduce the memory footprint when 3D
	options are used.

o	Modify the 3D cost reduction algorithm.  The new algorithm seems to
	offer better results than the old in cases tested thus far, and does
	not require that spatial extension be enabled.

o	Add support for the Canon 300D with a 50mm f/1.4 lens (specifying view
	angle), as well as experimental support for the 50mm f/1.4 lens at 1.4
	(specifying a linear PSF).  Also add support for 50mm f/1.8 and 85mm
	f/1.8 lenses, specifying view angles as specified in the chart at
	http://www.acapixus.dk/photography/angle_of_view.htm

o	Don't output final data when --psf-match is specified.  Doing so
	would be useless anyway, and apparently causes a segfault.

o	For cases where --psf-match is specified, modify the exposure settings
	for the final input image (i.e., reference image) so that default
	exposure is used, and modify the bayer pattern settings so that no
	bayer pattern is used.  (The first of these modifications requires
	changes in the way that the array of input exposures is stored.)

o	Optionally (when OPTIMIZATIONS == 1) use the output of the default
	rendering chain directly as the Irani-Peleg initial approximation,
	instead of copying it.

o	Add support for PSF convolution and scalar multiplication.

o	Move all PSF parsing logic to a new file: d2/render/psf/psf_parse.h

o	Modify help argument processing so that several help arguments can be
	specified at a time.  Change the usage text to reflect this.

o	Fix concatenated help output; outputs from all help options are now
	represented.  (3D help had been omitted in 0.7.2.)

o	Add a check to ensure that at most one --q* option is specified.
	The issue of multiple --q* options being specified was raised on the
	ALE mailing list by Viktors Rotanovs.  As there is currently no
	support for this, generating an error message is appropriate.


V	0.7.2 2004-Oct-26

o	Add cost-minimizing code to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D inputs.
	(This code is currently very experimental.)

o	Add rudimentary device support for raw, linear files from the Canon
	EOS 300D (Digital Rebel) SLR.  CRW files may not be directly usable
	under all configurations; in cases where they are not, Dave Coffin's
	dcraw program, with arguments -d -4, will produce a raw, linear PPM
	file.  See http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

o	Add a new option --gs-mo to establish a minimum overlap area for
	global searches.  This may allow more of Derrick Brashear's historical
	USGS contour map image sets to align successfully.  (from
	0.7.1-patch2)

o	Allow the scale factor to be explicitly set to one. (from
	0.7.1-patch2)

o	Print version information to stdout instead of stderr. (from
	0.7.1-patch2)

o	Add a rudimentary test suite. (from 0.7.1-patch2)

o	Add support for --perturb-{upper,lower}=x%, where the value x% is
	specified as a percentage of the smallest image dimension.  Use of
	percentages to specify bounds was suggested by Jeff Epler. (from 
	0.7.1-patch1)

o	In render::is_excluded(), add the offset before checking exclusion
	regions. (from 0.7.1-patch1)

o	Add code to shrink the accumulated image in d2/render/incremental.h,
	so that superfluously large undefined areas are never present.  This
	may improve operation of '--gs inner' in some cases. (from
	0.7.1-patch1)

o	In d2::align::_align(), rescale default_initial_alignment in parallel
	with the current transformation, so that it can be used again, if
	necessary. (from 0.7.1-patch1)

o	Add experimental options --perturb-source and --perturb-output, which
	allow some refinement of the manner in which perturbation occurs.
	(from 0.7.1-patch1)


V	0.7.1 2004-Aug-27

o	Fix --visp segfault when not using last: filters.

o	Add help mode --hA to display all help pages.

o	Add circular point-spread function option "circle=<diameter>".

o	Add support for the ov7620 sensor (raw, linear modes only).  (Updated
	from 0.7.0-patch1 to specify a linear PSF.)

o	Add global search option --gs to fix an alignment problem reported by
	Bert Douglas.  (Also included in 0.7.0-patch1.)

o	Change transformation::eu_{get,set,modify}() so that externally
	visible values are interpreted in the context of transformations
	between scaled images, while internal values represent transformations
	between unscaled images.  (Bugfix for 0.7.0.  Also included in
	0.7.0-patch1.)

o	d2/tfile.h: Ensure that eu[] parameters are properly scaled when read
	and written.  (Bugfix for 0.7.0. Also included in 0.7.0-patch1.)

o	Fix order-of-operations bug in d2::image::scale_by_half().  (Bugfix
	for 0.7.0 and earlier versions.  Also included in 0.7.0-patch1.)

o	Scale alignment weights for reduced level-of-detail in d2::align().
	(Also included in 0.7.0-patch1.)

o	For reduced level-of-detail alignment reference images, filter
	using alignment weights.  (Also included in 0.7.0-patch1.)

o	Add speed optimizations for filtering in the Euclidean case, but
	leave these disabled, since they are not safe.  (Also included
	in 0.7.0-patch1.)


V	0.7.0 2004-Aug-06

o	Add support for algorithmic alignment weights.  This requires 
	POSIX fork() and execlp(), so add a Makefile variable for POSIX.

o	Add support for frequency-based alignment weights.  Angelo Pesce
	had initially suggested the related (or more general) idea of
	edge-based alignment.  Frequencies were chosen because of their
	conceptual simplicity.  This option requires that FFTW be linked.

o	Add support for specifying per-pixel and per-channel alignment weights
	by providing an additional weight-map image, as suggested by Bert
	Douglas.

o	Remove support for USM.

o	Add multiple default settings: q0, q1, q2, qn, qr.

o	Partition help into sections, and add a section for transformation
	data file help.

o	Add a device type for the XVP610 camera in 640x480 mode.

o	Modify the divisor in d2/render/ipc.h to ensure convergence when
	using multiple varieties.

o	Add experimental handling for Bayer patterns.

o	Add experimental video stabilization options.

o	Add options to control output range.  By default, use the range of the
	original frame.

o	For incremental rendering, add general filtering options.  Drizzling
	options are no longer supported as such, but the help output offers
	examples of how to emulate old drizzling/merging techniques (roughly).

o	Add options --fail-default and --fail-optimal to select the desired
	failure mode.  --fail-default uses the default alignment in the case
	of failure.
	
o	Add option --ex, to support exclusion volumes.  Region exclusion was
	first suggested to the author by Dewayne VanHoozer as a means of
	solving the 'closed eye problem' in group photography.

o	Add a barrel distortion adjustment multiplier and rate options.

o	In d2/transformation.h, add parameters for barrel distortion correction.
	In d2/tfile.h, add new barrel distortion command 'B'.  The approach
	taken is based on that of Helmut Dersch's PanoTools.  (i.e., a
	polynomial in radial distance is used.)

o	Increment the latest supported transformation file syntax to version
	3.  This version supports transformation of the original frame, as
	well as other new features described above.

o	Move d2/gpt.h to d2/transformation.h.

o	In d2::align, add support for original frame transformations.

o	In d2::align::diff() and d2::align::set_exposure_ratio(), treat cases
	with and without extension identically.

o	Report unrecognized transformation file commands as errors instead of
	warnings.

o	In the transformation data file handler, report incompatible
	transformation types as an error instead of as a warning.


V	0.6.0 2004-Feb-10

o	Add a generalized, but rudimentary, implementation of Steve Mann's
	notion of 'certainty'.  For more details, see
	http://wearcam.org/comparametrics.pdf

o	Make stdin filter height and width independent of each other.

o	In the Irani-Peleg renderer, skip frames that fail to reach the match
	threshold.

o	Convert some operations on pixels and points into vector syntax 
	through C++ operator overloading.

o	Add command-line options to select plain or raw PNM/PPM formats.  Remove
	makefile variable PLAIN.

o	Add command-line options to select 8/16 bits per channel.  Remove
	makefile variable BITS.

o	Revise the device configuration xvp610_320x240 to use a new
	filter, reflecting driver updates (see the relevant web page
	http://auricle.dyndns.org/xvp610/ ) and support for non-linear
	colorspace point-spread functions.

o	In the Irani-Peleg renderer, use a discrete Fourier transform to
	ensure that each (point-spread function, backprojection kernel) pair
	satisfies condition (9) from theorem 4.1 in the source paper.

o	Add a point-spread function rasterizer.  

o	Extend the --replace option to support drizzling.

o	Add support for exposure registration (i.e., matching of exposure
	between different frames).

o	Change -Os to -O2 in the Makefile, since -Os no longer achieves speedup
	in the most critical codepaths.

o	Add command-line support for summation of point-spread functions.

o	Add a polymorphic point-spread function type psf and convert all
	external interfaces of ipc.h and usm.h (formerly hf-enhance.h) to use
	this type.  

o	Fix memory leak in d2/render/combine.h:get_image().  (This fix is also
	included in a patch for 0.5.1.)

o	Modify the USM renderer to write output when incremental output is
	enabled.

o	In the USM renderer, now only defined pixel values contribute to the
	mask.  Also, undefined values are no longer masked.

o	Update e-mail address information.

o	Modify the Irani-Peleg calibration script into a general point-spread
	function calibration script, using a new built-in point-spread function
	evaluation module to rate candidates.

o	Irani-Peleg and USM (High-frequency enhancement) renderers now
	use the same point-spread function configurations.  New options --ips,
	--usm, --lpsf, --nlpsf, and --device subsume and extend the
	functionality provided by options --ip, --ipc, and --hf-enhance.

o	Add support for convolutions in non-linear colorspace.  This feature
	is enabled and configured by the command-line option --nlpsf.  (See
	also the item above.)

o	Linearize channel values within internal data structures so that most 
	ALE operations are performed on linear data.  Steve Mann discusses the
	use of linear representations in image processing, e.g. in his paper
	http://wearcam.org/comparametrics.pdf .  We assume a simple power-law
	response by default.

o	Modify the image class to use a floating-point data type for 
	storing pixels.

o	Modify the README to remove information covered in the User Manual.

o	Revise identifiers and comments in d2/render/ipc.h to better reflect
	the terminology used in the source paper by Irani and Peleg.

o	Consoldiate code for computing the position and dimensions of a pixel in a
	new coordinate system, and use this new abstraction to reduce the code
	size of d2/render/ipc.h and d2/render/drizzle.h (Irani-Peleg and
	drizzling code, respectively).

o	Change several instances of 'double', 'float', and 'my_real' to
	specialized floating-point types 'ale_real', 'ale_pos', 'ale_sreal',
	and 'ale_accum'.

o	Fix offset calculation in d2/render/ipc.h.  This is necessary for
	Irani-Peleg rendering of image mosaics extending upwards or to the
	left of the original frame.  (This fix is also included in a patch for
	0.5.1.)

o	Move classes treating snapshots as two-dimensional data to directory
	'd2' and create an associated C++ namespace.  We can't use '2d' to
	label the namespace, because the C++ grammar won't allow it.


V	0.5.1 2003-Nov-19

o	Several of the changes below are based on a suggestion by Bert
	Douglas regarding support for 16-bit-per-channel color.  See the README
	for more information about relevant compilation options.

o	Add information to the README regarding new compilation options.

o	Modify the makefile to accept a variable BITS, and differentiate between
	values BITS=8 and BITS=16.  The latter option causes the macro BITS_16
	to be defined during compilation.
	
o	Modify image_rw.h to handle 16-bit data when BITS_16 is defined.  Also,
	differentiate between 8-bit and 16-bit ImageMagick builds by checking
	MaxRGB.

o	In ppm.h, add carriage returns to the set of recognized whitespace
	characters.

o	Modify ppm.h to read 16-bit binary PPM files (added to the PPM format
	spec in April 2000).  

o	Modify ppm.h to read plain (ASCII) as well as raw (binary) PPM files.  

o	Add a Makefile option for writing plain (ASCII) PPM files instead of
	raw (binary).  This option causes the macro PPM_PLAIN to be defined
	during compilation.
	
o	Modify ppm.h to write plain (ASCII) PPM files when PPM_PLAIN is defined.

o	Modify ppm.h to output 16-bit PPM files when BITS_16 is defined.

o	Modify ppm.h to scale input intensity values based on the internal
	representation depth (8 or 16 bits per channel).

o	Add a file 'channel.h' to describe the color channel data type and
	valid range, both being dependent on whether BITS_16 is defined.  Use
	these generic values, where appropriate, throughout the ALE codebase.


V	0.5.0 2003-Nov-02

o	Remove certain cloning operations from align.h, but since cursory tests
	indicate that scaling with --scale is much more expensive than cloning,
	allow cloning to occur when scaling occurs.

o	Add more comment documentation to header files.

o	Emit a more informative error message when the PPM file handler
	encounters a file that is not a well-formed PPM binary file.

o	Move rendering implementations to subdirectory 'render/'.

o	Modify semantics of alignment following by applying to file-loaded
	initial transformations a delta transformation D = AB^-1, where B is
	the previous frame's (unmodified) initial transformation, A is the
	previous frame's final transformation, and ^-1 is the inverse operator.
	Using --follow with --trans-load can now improve alignment success when
	working with panoramic image mosaics.

o	We're not using simulated annealing, so remove comments that claim
	otherwise.

o	Remove certain unsafe assumptions from ipc/* (now render/ipc/*); this
	change includes a modification to ipc.h (now render/ipc.h).  Limits of
	the rectangle used as an argument to the <type>::response() function
	are now explicitly given rather than implied.

o	Change documentation for --replace.


V	0.4.8 2003-Aug-01

o	Modify Irani-Peleg renderer to produce incremental output.

o	Modify Monte Carlo alignment so that the same set of accumulated image
	pixels is examined when comparing two transformations.

o	Add an option for additional upper-bound constraint of rotational
	perturbation.  Jeff Epler had noted that the
	perturb-upper/perturb-lower options alone may not be suited to working
	with sets of higher-resolution images.  

o	Resolve a bug introduced in version 0.1.1 which had limited rotational
	perturbation to 2 degrees.

o	Add an option to adjust the maximum level of detail used.  The default
	maximum is 2/perturb, which matches the default for previous versions
	of ALE.

o	Modify names of temporary files used in the calibration script.


V	0.4.7 2003-Jul-27

o	Add a replacement option suggested by Jeff Treece.  This option can
	be used to facilitate video stabilization.

o	Irani-Peleg: add support for configurable modules, including 
	a module that reads its configuration data from standard input
	and a module calibrated for an IBM (Xirlink) XVP610 in 320x240
	mode.  A rudimentary script for calibrating devices with unknown
	projection functions has been included as ipc/ale-calibrate.

o	Irani-Peleg: don't truncate correction values in backprojection.

o	Irani-Peleg: don't multiply the weight function by a scale correction
	factor in backprojection.

o	Rename render::operator()() to render::sync().  Update subclasses
	accordingly.


V	0.4.6 2003-Jul-01

o	Allow --ip and --hf-enhance to be used together.  [Modify
	ip::operator() and hf_filter::operator() so that multiple
	post-processing filters can be used.]

o	Initialize the drizzled image to be uniformly black.  This fixes
	a bug introduced in 0.4.2.

o	Allocate the correct size image for drizzling.  This fixes a bug
	introduced in 0.4.5.


V	0.4.5 2003-Jun-23

o	Ensure correct transformation scaling and difference calculation after
	alignment is complete, even if alignment terminates with a reduced
	level of detail (i.e. perturb-lower > 2).

o	Separate the scale() function into two cases: scale() is reserved for
	scale factors greater than or equal to one, as in user-specified
	scaling; and scale_by_half() is used for the scale factor 0.5, needed
	to provide multiple levels of detail in alignment.  Modify the
	scale_by_half() case to reflect source pixel values more fairly.  (This
	change affects alignment behavior at reduced levels of detail.)

o	Reduce whitespace in usage() message.

o	Modify align::diff() to use correctly scaled image offset values.
	(Bugfix for alignment with --extend.)

o	Modify align.h so that the image definition array is correctly scaled
	for all levels of detail.  (Bugfix for alignment with --extend.)

o	Modify image.h to correctly handle image offset values.  (Bugfix
	for --extend operation.)

o	Remove call to stat() in image_rw.h.  This improves OS independence,
	and apparently also allows URL-specification of images when compiled
	with ImageMagick support.

o	Modify image file handler interface so that input files are not scaled.
	Perform scaling, when necessary, outside of the file handler.  Since
	unscaled data is needed by the drizzling and Irani-Peleg code, this
	fixes bugs in those modules.  


V	0.4.4 2003-Jun-06

o	Modify the Monte Carlo pixel selection algorithm so that the expected
	number of sampled pixels more closely matches the specified number in
	typical cases.

o	Specify the binary mode flag to fopen() calls in the PPM file handler.
	This change resolves a bug discovered by Benjamin Hill.


V	0.4.3 2003-May-30

o	Add support for Monte Carlo alignment of images, in which only a
	random subset of pixels is sampled.

o	Add an option to disable incremental image output.


V	0.4.2 2003-May-23

o	Implement an image reconstruction option based on the work of Irani and
	Peleg.

o	Clean up source; move rendering and alignment functions into separate
	files.

o	Change valid drizzling diameter interval to (0,1].

o	Modify PPM file reader to correctly handle comments in PPM files; this
	resolves a bug pointed out by Benjamin Hill.

o	Add missing typecast to resolve compile warning under GCC 3.2.

o	Make changes to gpt.h that may reduce the Euclidean alignment time.

o	Move ale.c to ale.cc to follow one of the many C++ naming conventions.


V	0.4.1 2003-Apr-28

o	Change language to C++.

o	Code cleanup in ale.c, image.h, and gpt.h.

o	Separate into a number of subsections the option descriptions in the
	README 

o	Add URL information to README

o	Add an experimental drizzling implementation.  Research on drizzling
	by Richard Hook and Andrew Fruchter was brought to the attention of 
	the author by Dan Kaminsky.

o	Add an option to use the previous frame's final transformation as the
	default alignment.

o	Change pixel weight data type so that more than 255 images can
	be merged.

o	Add support for increased spatial extents.  Research on increased
	spatial extents by Steve Mann was brought to the attention of the
	author by Dan Egnor.

o	Modify the transformation algorithm to use transformations from the
	domain of the input image to the range of the target image.  This
	change is reflected in transformation files.  Maintain support for
	old transformation file versions, however.

o	Add version information to transformation files and update the version
	from 0 to 2.


V	0.4.0p1 2003-Apr-04

o	Merge a bugfix from Debian ALE package version 0.4.0-1.  Without this
	fix, an assertion failure can occur when ImageMagick support is
	enabled.  Original fix implemented by Nick Rusnov.  


V	0.4.0 2003-Mar-30

o	Add support for general scaling parameters (i.e. all scale 
	factors >= 1.0).  --scale2, --scale4, and --scale8 are now deprecated, 
	and replaced with a more general --scale=x argument.

o	Support enhancement of high frequencies even when the scale factor is 
	1.0.

o	Modify the high-frequency filter algorithm to support filtering near
	the border of an image.

o	Modify the high-frequency filter function so that the response is now
	(4/n)^2 times what it used to be, where n is the scale factor.  


V	0.3.2 2003-Mar-26

o	Don't filter high frequencies if we're not enhancing them.  This 
	improves efficiency, but should not affect output.



V	0.3.1 2003-Mar-25

o	Output average match statistic.

o	Update informational output to transformation files to include original 
	frame.

o	Add support for post-enhancement of high-frequency details.


V	0.3.0 2003-Jan-17

o	Add support for loading and saving transformation data.

o	Add an option to set the upper bound on correction steps.

o	Modify Makefile to compile with size optimization, since this 
	appears to improve speed characteristics in some cases.

/alignment
o	Move transformation data structure and related functions to 
	a separate header file.


V	0.2.0 2003-Jan-01

o	Add support for general projective transformations, and change/add
	options as follows:

		'--translation'	used to be	'--no-rotate'
		'--euclidean'	used to be 	'--rotate'
		'--projective'	is a new option


V	0.1.2 2002-Dec-13

o	Add optional support for .jpg, .png, .tiff, and other file formats
	through ImageMagick.  Translation using ImageMagick was suggested by
	Nick Rusnov.

/image-files
o	Don't segfault if a file can't be opened.


V	0.1.1 2002-Dec-09

o	Use reduced levels of detail in coarser alignment steps to increase
	speed.

o	Change perturbation step lower-bound check from less-than ('<') to 
	less-than-or-equal-to ('<=').  Change default lower bound
	to .125 from .1 (the behavior is the same, but the value
	makes more sense).

o	Change perturbation initial value to 32 pixels from
	16 pixels, since coarse alignment is now less expensive.

o	Modify scale function so that the borders aren't 
	corrupted (too badly).


V	0.1.0 2002-Nov-26

o	Add support for correction of rotation about the lens axis.

o	Add an optional match criterion for merging.

o	Add an option to adjust minimum step-size.

o	Add flags to specify which channels to use for alignment.  Use
	a summation of all channels by default.

o	Add an option to modify the error metric exponent, and change
	the default value from 1 to 2. 

o	Display information about how well a new image matches
	the accumulated image.

o	Add a rule for ale.exe to the Makefile.  


V	0.0.0 2002-Oct-11

/initial-release
o	Initial release.
