<chapter id="user-psf"><title>Point Spread Functions</title>
<p>The ALE Irani-Peleg renderer uses a point-spread function to model the optical
and electronic properties of the capture device used.  The PSF can be specified
in terms of one linear and one non-linear component.</p>

<s><t>PSF specification</t>

<p>The PSF can be explicitly specified by using one or both of the psf options.</p>

<ll>--lpsf &lt;p>        Set linear colorspace point-spread function to &lt;p>
--nlpsf &lt;p>       Set non-linear colorspace point-spread function to &lt;p>
</ll>

<p>Available explicit point-spread functions are as follows:</p>

<ll>box=&lt;d>           Set the PSF to a box filter with diameter &lt;d>.
circle=&lt;d>        Set the PSF to a circular filter with diameter &lt;d>.
stdin             Specify a custom filter at runtime.
stdin_vg          stdin with vertically-oriented gaps after every 8th pixel.
&lt;p>+&lt;p>           Summation of two functions
&lt;p>^&lt;p>           Convolution of two functions.
&lt;n>*&lt;p>           Multiplication by a scalar &lt;n>.
</ll>

<p>If a device is known to ALE, then its PSF can be implicitly set with the
<l>--device</l> option.  (See the <a href="../../device/">device</a> page
for more information.)  If a device is not specified, then the default linear
PSF component is <l>box=1</l>.  The non-linear PSF component is disabled
by default.</p>

</s><s><t>Determining the PSF</t>

<p>The PSF can be approximated based on images of known scenes.  The ALE source
distribution includes an experimental script that numerically approximates the
PSF in this way (<l>d2/render/psf/ale-psf-calibrate</l>).  Other, more
efficient methods for approximating the PSF are likely possible, however.</p>
