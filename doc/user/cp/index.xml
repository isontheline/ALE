<chapter id="user-cp"><title>Control Points</title>

<p>Control points are used for 2D and 3D alignment, and to constrain 3D scene
models.  Control point data is loaded from a control point file.  Scripts to
generate and manipulate control point files are included in the
<code>scripts</code> directory of the source distribution; the file
specification is outlined in the final section below.</p>

<s><t>Loading a Control Point File</t>

<p>The --cpf-load= option is used to load data from a control point file.</p>

<pre>--cpf-load=&lt;f>    Load control point data from file &lt;f>   [0.8.1 and later]
</pre>

</s><s><t>Control Point File Format (version 0)</t>

<p>The version 0 control point file format consists of a version command followed
by a sequence of control points, with one control point per line of the file.</p>

<pre>V 0
<i>Control Point 1</i>
<i>Control Point 2</i>
<i>Control Point 3</i>

<p>Control points can be one of three types:</p>

<s><t>Type A control points</t>

<p>Type A control points specify a sequence of 2D points, one for each frame,
where each point is specified as a pair of floating point numbers.  If there is
no data for a frame, then "nan" should be specified.  E.g.:</p>

<pre>A 20  30  nan nan 10  10  10  15
A 23  22  25  25  nan nan nan nan
</pre>

</s><s><t>Type B control points</t>

<p>Type B control points specify a 3D coordinate.  E.g.:</p>

<pre>B 10 30 -400
B 10 15 -425
</pre>

</s><s><t>Type C control points</t>

<p>Type C control points specify both 2D and 3D data.  There is a single 3D point
specified, as well as one 2D point for each frame.  The 3D point appears at the
end of the line.  E.g.:</p>

<pre>C 20  30  nan nan 10  10  10  15  10 30 -400
C 23  22  25  25  nan nan nan nan 10 15 -425
</pre>
