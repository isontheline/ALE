<chapter id="user-ui"><title>User Interfaces</title>

<p>ALE currently supports two user interface types.  The traditional interface
is the stream interface, which produces only printing characters and
whitespace.  If ALE is compiled with IOCTL support, additional information can
be provided through the tty interface, which is default.</p>

<pre>--ui=&lt;type&gt;       Set user interface to &lt;type&gt;, one of:
                     stream
                     tty [default]
</pre>
