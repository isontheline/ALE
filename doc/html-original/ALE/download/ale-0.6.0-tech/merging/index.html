<h1>Merging</h1>

Merging uses bilinear interpolation to determine each frame's contribution to
the accumulated image, with each contribution assigned equal weight.  Where
bilinear interpolation does not define a value, the accumulated image pixel is
not updated.  Sections below outline the properties of this approach.

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3>Convolution with the Bartlett (triangle) filter as the limiting case</h3>

<p>Assuming predicates for translation and point sampling, bilinear
interpolation is equivalent to convolution with a Bartlett filter.  Combined
with the box filter approximation, jittering assumptions, and Bartlett filter
approximation, the result of merging should be an acceptable approximation of
<b>T</b>.  This should be proven at some point.  Until then, this result should
be considered unreliable.

<h3>Density and false local minima</h3>

<p>Informally, the merging method outlined above always updates a dense set
of pixels in the accumulated image.  In particular, any accumulated image pixel
whose center falls on a line between updated pixels is also an updated pixel.

<p>It is conceivable that this property reduces the likelihood of alignment
failure due to entrapment in local minima; hence, the merging renderer is
always used as a reference for the <a href="../alignment/">alignment</a>
algorithm.  Except in cases where a large radius is used, <a
href="../drizzling/">drizzling</a> does not share these properties.</p>

<!--
<p>Define a dense update method to be one that 

<p>The merging method outlined above has the property of always updating a
dense set of pixels in the accumulated image (i.e. any accumulated image pixel
whose center falls on a line between updated pixels is also an updated pixel,
and all updated pixels are connected by a path consisting of only updated
pixels), even when the accumulated image is of finer resolution than the new
frame.  This ensures that the area of defined pixels in the accumulated image
is dense and that any uniform change in intensity between frames is reflected
uniformly over a dense area.  The absence of these properties may cause
alignment to fail due to entrapment in local minima, and so merging is always
used internally to create the renderings used by the alignment algorithm.
Except in the case of a large pixel footprint, <a
href="../drizzling">drizzling</a> does not share these properties.
