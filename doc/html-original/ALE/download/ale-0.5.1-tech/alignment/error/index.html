<h1>Error Functions</h1>

<p>Error functions are used to determine whether a transformation is "good" or
not, and in particular, whether one transformation is better or worse than
another.  In particular, a smaller error indicates a better transformation.

<!--
The error functions used by ALE are based on two principles:

<ol>
<li>A relatively small change in camera position or orientation should be
reflected by a small transformation.
<li>When a new frame is merged, the accumulated image should change as little
as possible.
</ol>
-->
<!--

<p>Since sufficiently large transformations can move a new frame so far that it
no longer overlaps the accumulated image, it is important that the alignment
process not mistakenly move images too far, although in principle it is
possible, as in the case of a chain-link fence, that two fairly similar images
do, in fact, represent areas that are spatially separated.  This is the
motivation for the first criterion.

<p>The second criterion is based on the general idea that, if two inputs to ALE
look vaguely like a petunia, the output should look like a petunia also.  Hence
it should typically be the case that the accumulated image not change much when
new frames are merged.  

-->
<p>ALE defines error functions for each pixel of the accumulated image, and
also a comprehensive error function that summarizes the error over all 
pixels.  

<h3>Per-Pixel Error Functions</h3>

<p>Since differences in exposure may alter the absolute values of pixels even
in images that are perfectly aligned, ALE usually normalizes the images so that
overall image intensity matches.  This normalization step does not affect the
pixel values contributing to the merged image, but it does affect the values
with which the per-pixel error function is calculated.  (The normalization
step is skipped when --extend or --follow is specified.)

<!-- <p>(Alternatives to normalization exist, including the use of inner products; see
Steve Mann's paper, available on the website linked in footnote 1, for a
discussion of alignment approaches.)  -->

<!--
<p>Based on principle 2, ALE calculates the difference between each accumulated
image pixel and the value with which it would be merged given a candidate
transformation.  This latter value is the <i>overlapping value</i>, as
described in the section on <a href="../../merging/">merging</a>.  This difference
is then raised by the error metric exponent, as specified by the --metric
option.  The exponent defaults to 2.0 for ALE versions 0.1.0 and later, or 1.0
for version 0.0.0.  Hence, 
-->
<p>The per-pixel error function for pixel <i>(i, j)</i> in the accumulated
image <i>A</i>, frame <i>B</i>, and transformation <i>T</i>, is:

<p><blockquote>
<pre>
<i>p(i, j, A, B, T) = Abs( A(i, j) - B(T_inverse(i, j)) )<sup>metric_exponent</sup></i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where <i>Abs()</i> is the absolute value function and <i>B(T_inverse(i, j))</i>
is the overlapping value described in the <a href="../../merging/">merging</a> section.
If not specified by the --metric option, <i>metric_exponent</i> defaults to 2.0
for ALE versions 0.1.0 and later, or 1.0 for version 0.0.0.

<p>In addition to the per-pixel error function, a per-pixel <i>maximum error
estimator</i> is calculated, as follows:

<p><blockquote>
<pre>
<i>p_max(i, j, A, B, T) = Max( A(i, j), B(T_inverse(i, j)) )<sup>metric_exponent</sup></i>
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Comprehensive Error Functions</h3>

There are two varieties of comprehensive error function used by ALE: an
<i>exhaustive</i> error function and, in versions 0.4.3 and later,  a
<a href="mc/"><i>Monte Carlo</i></a> error function.  Whereas the exhaustive function
evaluates the error for each pixel in the accumulated image, the <a href="mc/">Monte
Carlo</a> function evaluates only a subset of pixels.  <!-- The latter may require
less time to compute, possibly at the expense of precision.  -->
<p>If we consider <i>Sum[]</i> to provide the sum over whatever
subset of pixels we are sampling (including possibly the set of all pixels), then
the comprehensive error function, for accumulated image <i>A</i>, frame
<i>B</i>, and transformation <i>T</i>, is:

<p><blockquote>
<pre>
<i>E(A, B, T) = (Sum [ p(i, j, A, B, T) ] / Sum [ p_max(i, j, A, B, T) ])<sup>(1/metric_exponent)</sup></i>
</pre>
</blockquote>
