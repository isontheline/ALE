<h1>ALE Version 0.7.x/0.8.x Technical Description <!-- <small>(or the best approximation to date)</small> --> </h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This page discusses motivation, related work, models of program input,
renderers, and the alignment algorithm, but does not cover the 3D scene
reconstruction code in versions 0.7.2 and later.  Note also that some changes
in 0.8.x might not yet be covered.  For information on ALE program operation and
usage, see the User Manual for <a href="../ale-0.7.x-user/">0.7.x</a> or <a
href="../ale-0.8.x-user/">0.8.x</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note: This document uses HTML 4 character entities. &nbsp;Sigma is '&Sigma;'; summation is '&sum;'</b>.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Several factors in the imaging pipeline can affect output, sometimes
degrading image quality, either individually or through combination.  Lens
effects include barrel or pincushion distortion; the camera sensor and
electronics can produce blurring, signal aliasing, noise, quantization, and
non-linear effects; analog video signals can degrade in transmission; and
various compression techniques and digital enhancements on- or off-camera can
destroy image features.  In some cases, a better image can be produced through
combining information contained in different images.</p>

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<p>Richard Hook and Andrew Fruchter's <a
href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/adass/adassVI/hookr.html">drizzling technique</a> was designed
to combine dithered undersampled images.  Previous versions of ALE supported this
technique; the current version supports an approximation.

<p>Steve Mann's work (e.g. <a href="http://wearcam.org/orbits/">here</a> and <a
href="http://wearcam.org/comparam.htm">here</a>), on spatial extents,
projective transformations, linear-colorspace image processing, and weighting
by certainty functions, motivated ALE's adoption of these features.  A
modified, "one-sided" approach to certainty is used by ALE's Irani-Peleg
renderer, to better accommodate extremely bright features that exceed the range
of all input images.  This approach is modified further in 0.8.0 to rely on
estimated (instead of measured) intensities, which may allow further reduction
of noise in some cases.

<p>ALE incorporates an iterative solver based on Michal Irani and Shmuel
Peleg's <a
href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~irani/abstracts/superResolution.html">iterative
deblurring and super-resolution</a> technique.  It has been extended to handle
convolutions occurring in tandem in different colorspaces, and has been
modified for certainty weighting.

<p>ALE's treatment of barrel distortion, using a polynomial in distance from
the image center, is based on that of Helmut Dersch's Panorama Tools.  ALE's
approach adjusts the linear (first-order) coefficient so that the corners of
the transformed frame remain in place.</p>

<h2>Program Inputs</h2>

<p>Define an <i>image</i> to be a function mapping a subset of 2D Euclidean space to
an RGB colorspace; define a <i>discrete image</i> to be an image defined only
at coordinates having integral components; define a <i>spatial discretization</i> 
to be an operator that restricts the domain of an image to a set of points
having integral components, thus producing a discrete image; define a <i>spatial
extension</i> to be an operator that extends the domain of a discrete image by 
assigning the value of the nearest neighbor point.

<p>Ignoring noise and color quantization, ALE assumes that each input frame
<b>d<sub>x</sub></b> is a discrete image that can be obtained by applying a
sequence of operators, including transformations, exposure adjustment,
convolutions, gamma correction, spatial discretization, and spatial extension,
to some image <b>d</b>, as follows:

<blockquote><b>
d<sub>x</sub> = DNCGDLE<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>d
</b></blockquote>

Where:

<ul>
<li><b>P<sub>x</sub></b> is a projective transformation
<li><b>B<sub>x</sub></b> is a barrel/pincushion distortion transformation
<li><b>E<sub>x</sub></b> is linear exposure adjustment
<li><b>L</b> is a convolution in linear colorspace
<li><b>D</b> is a spatial discretization
<li><b>G</b> is gamma correction
<li><b>C</b> is a spatial extension
<li><b>N</b> is a convolution in non-linear colorspace
</ul>

(When ALE aligns using Euclidean transformations, <b>P<sub>x</sub></b> are
assumed to be Euclidean.)

<p>The presence of an extension operator between <b>G</b> and <b>N</b> is
suspect, and is somewhat inelegant in the case of digitally processed data, but
although such extension may require careful selection of <b>N</b>, it does not
restrict the set of possible models.  It is only included because it creates a
parallelism between <b>N</b> and <b>L</b> that makes implementation easier.
In a more sophisticated implementation, it could be removed.</p>

<h2>Incremental Rendering</h2>

<p>If <b>L</b> and <b>N</b> are assumed to behave as identity operators, then each
pixel in each input frame corresponds to a single point in <b>d</b>.  In this
case, it may be possible to apply filtering operations to input frame pixels
directly.  One caveat, however, is that different parts of the output may be
sampled with unequal density in the input frame sequence; hence, a filtering
approach that is uniform over all regions could cause significant aliasing or
detail loss.  Instead, ALE uses a non-uniform approach.  If <b>I<sub>n</sub>(i,
j)</b> is an output pixel, at position <b>(i, j)</b>, updated for input frames
zero through <b>n</b>, then:

<blockquote>
<b>I<sub>n</sub>(i, j) = </b>&sum;<sub>n'&isin;0..n</sub>&sum;<sub>(i',j')&isin;Dom[d<sub>n'</sub>]</sub> <b>E<sub>n'</sub><sup>-1</sup>G<sup>-1</sup>d<sub>n'</sub>(i',j') * c(n, n', i, j, i', j', E<sub>0</sub>, ..., E<sub>n</sub>, G, P<sub>0</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub>, B<sub>0</sub>, ..., B<sub>n</sub>, d<sub>0</sub>, ..., d<sub>n</sub>)</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Where <b>c</b> is a <a href="chain/">rendering chain</a>.  Note that for most
types of rendering chains, the above expression can be simplified considerably.

<h2>Irani-Peleg Rendering</h2>

ALE's Irani-Peleg renderer iteratively updates the final output of incremental
rendering, with update operator U:

<blockquote>
<b>J<sub>0</sub> = I<sub>final</sub></b>
<br>
<b>J<sub>1</sub> = UJ<sub>0</sub></b>
<br>
.
<br>
.
<br>
.
<br>
<b>J<sub>k</sub> = UJ<sub>k-1</sub></b>
</blockquote>

Where <b>U</b> is the <a href="ip_update_rule/">Irani-Peleg update rule</a>.

<h2>Spatial Extension and Space Complexity</h2>

<p>By default, the output image is of fixed size, limited to the extents of
<b>d<sub>0</sub></b>, the first image in the input sequence; the 'extend' option
specifies that output should accommodate all regions of all input images.

<p>When rendering an output image of fixed size, image storage space in memory
for all non-median rendering types is <i>O(1)</i> in the number of input frames
and <i>O(n)</i> in the number of pixels per input frame, since at most one
input image is loaded into memory at any time.  For median-value rendering,
storage is O(n) in the number of input frames.  When using projectively-aligned
input images, however, renderings that accommodate all regions of all input
images can generate arbitrarily large output for a bounded input size, and can
use an arbitrarily large amount of memory.

<h2>Alignment Algorithm</h2>

<p>Details on the alignment algorithm used in ALE are <a href="alignment/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>3D Scene Reconstruction</h2>

<p>The scene reconstruction code is still very experimental and is not
currently covered by this document.  For more information, see the user manual
and source code.
