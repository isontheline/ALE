<h1>Alignment</h1>

<p>ALE aligns each supplemental frame, in sequence, with an <i>alignment
reference image</i> constructed from previous frames.  This page outlines
supported transformation classes, the algorithm used for alignment, and the
properties of the alignment algorithm.  Following this is a discussion of
practical use of alignment options, including alignment classes and alignment
in the case of spatial extension.

<h2>Transformations</h2>

<p>ALE offers the following classes of transformations: </p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Translations</td><td>introduced in version 0.0.0</td>
<tr><td>Euclidean transformations (excluding reflections)</td><td>introduced in version 0.1.0</td>
<tr><td>Projective transformations</td><td>introduced in version 0.2.0</td>
<tr><td>Barrel distortion correction</td><td>introduced in version 0.7.0</td>
</table>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>Alignment proceeds by a deterministic search, beginning with an initial
transformation and modifying this transformation through a series of
perturbations.

<p>The initial transformation may be loaded from a file (when
<code>--trans-load</code> is used) or selected by default, or may be the
result of a global search (when <code>--gs</code> is used [0.7.1 only]).  The
default initial transformation is either the transformation of the original
frame (when the <code>--identity</code> option is specified) or the most
recently aligned frame's final alignment (when the <code>--follow</code> option
is specified).  When the initial transformation is loaded from a file, and if
the <code>--follow</code> option is specified, any changes to the alignment of
the previous frame are applied to the current frame at the outset.

<p>Once the initial transformation is determined, an initial perturbation
amount determines the step size by which each of the transformation parameters
are changed.  In translational or Euclidean alignment, the perturbation amount
is applied to translation -- in units of pixels on the two image axes -- and
rotation -- in units of degrees about the image center.  An additional
configurable upper bound, <code>--rot-upper</code>, constrains rotational
perturbation separately, preventing, e.g., a 360 degree perturbation of
rotation.  In the case of projective alignment, the perturbation amount is
applied to the position of the corners of the projected quadrilateral in units
of pixels, where the projection is from the boundary of the supplemental frame
into the coordinate system of the alignment reference image.  In the case of barrel
distortion correction, the perturbation amount is scaled by a multiplier
(<code>--bda-mult</code>) before being applied to each barrel distortion
coefficient (if any have been defined).  The rate of change of barrel distortion
coefficients per frame can be limited with the option <code>--bda-rate</code>.

<p>If possible, transformation parameters are changed to decrease the <a
href="error/">error</a> between the supplemental frame and the alignment reference
image.  The perturbation amount is halved whenever it is determined that no
parameter change of the current perturbation size improves the alignment of the
images.  A lower bound on the perturbation amount determines when the alignment
is complete.

<!--

XXX: Even if this was true at one point, it appears to no longer be true.

<p>The order in which parameters are considered for change is specified in the
source code, and has the following property: No modified parameter is
considered for further change until all other parameters have been considered.
A consequence of this property is that parameters are always considered in a
fixed (round robin) order.
-->

<p>When multiple levels of detail are used, the error may be calculated on
images with a reduced level of detail.  By default, this version of ALE uses a
level of detail twice as fine as the perturbation amount for perturbation
amounts larger than two, and full detail otherwise.  This behavior can be changed
by adjusting the <code>--lod-max</code> option.

<h2>Use of Alignment Classes</h2>

<p>ALE is likely to be most useful when corresponding regions of different
frames can be aligned by one of the available alignment classes.

<p>As described by Steve Mann in his work on <a
href="http://wearcam.org/orbits/">Video Orbits</a>, the projective
transformation offers particular versatility for camera imaging of (ideal
Lambertian) flat scenes.

<p>In camera imaging of scenes with depth, correction for orientation is almost
the same as for flat scenes, since, if focus and lens distortion is ignored, a
scene with depth is indistinguishable from a flat scene from the perspective of
a camera whose position is fixed.

<p>For sequences of camera images with small changes in position or
orientation, the projective transformations for alignment may closely
approximate Euclidean transformations; in this case, using Euclidean
transformations may achieve similar results and may require less time for
alignment, since there are fewer parameters to tweak (three parameters
instead of eight).

<p>In the case of flatbed scanners that preserve the relative height and width
of scans, any change in the position or orientation of flat objects can be
corrected using the Euclidean alignment class.</p>

<p>If a flatbed scanner does not preserve relative height and width, but does
preserve straight lines, then any change in the position or orientation of flat
objects can be corrected with the projective alignment class.

<p>However, even if a transformation is within the alignment class used, the
alignment algorithm may still be unable to approximate it.

<h2>Alignment in the case of Extended Renderings</h2>

<p>By using the --extend flag, ALE can be used to create image mosaics spanning
a spatial region larger than that represented by any single image in the frame
sequence.  In these cases, if adjacent frames in the sequence tend to be more
closely aligned with each other than they are with the original frame, it may
be helpful to also use the --follow flag as a hint to the alignment algorithm.
