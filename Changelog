0.1.1

o	Use reduced levels of detail in coarser alignment steps to increase
	speed.

o	Change perturbation step lower-bound check from less-than ('<') to 
	less-than-or-equal-to ('<=').  Change default lower bound
	to .125 from .1 (the behavior is the same, but the value
	makes more sense).

o	Change perturbation initial value to 32 pixels from
	16 pixels, since coarse alignment is now less expensive.

o	Modify scale function so that the borders aren't 
	corrupted (too badly).

0.1.0

o	Add support for correction of rotation about the lens axis.

o	Add an optional match criterion for merging.

o	Add an option to adjust minimum step-size.

o	Add flags to specify which channels to use for alignment.  Use
	a summation of all channels by default.

o	Add an option to modify the error metric exponent, and change
	the default value from 1 to 2. 

o	Display information about how well a new image matches
	the accumulated image.

o	Add a rule for ale.exe to the Makefile.  

0.0.0
	Initial release.
