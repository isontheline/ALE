0.4.0

o	Add support for general scaling parameters (i.e. all scale 
	factors >= 1.0).  --scale2, --scale4, and --scale8 are now deprecated, 
	and replaced with a more general --scale=x argument.

o	Support enhancement of high frequencies even when the scale factor is 
	1.0.

o	Modify the high-frequency filter algorithm to support filtering near
	the border of an image.

o	Modify the high-frequency filter function so that the response is now
	(4/n)^2 times what it used to be, where n is the scale factor.  

0.3.2

o	Don't filter high frequencies if we're not enhancing them.  This 
	improves efficiency, but should not affect output.

0.3.1

o	Output average match statistic.

o	Update informational output to transformation files to include original 
	frame.

o	Add support for post-enhancement of high-frequency details.

0.3.0

o	Add support for loading and saving transformation data.

o	Add an option to set the upper bound on correction steps.

o	Modify Makefile to compile with size optimization, since this 
	appears to improve speed characteristics in some cases.

o	Move transformation data structure and related functions to 
	a separate header file.

0.2.0

o	Add support for general projective transformations, and change/add
	options as follows:

		'--translation'	used to be	'--no-rotate'
		'--euclidean'	used to be 	'--rotate'
		'--projective'	is a new option

0.1.2

o	Add optional support for .jpg, .png, .tiff, and other file formats
	through ImageMagick.  Inspired by a translation script idea suggested
	by Nick Rusnov.

o	Don't segfault if a file can't be opened.

0.1.1

o	Use reduced levels of detail in coarser alignment steps to increase
	speed.

o	Change perturbation step lower-bound check from less-than ('<') to 
	less-than-or-equal-to ('<=').  Change default lower bound
	to .125 from .1 (the behavior is the same, but the value
	makes more sense).

o	Change perturbation initial value to 32 pixels from
	16 pixels, since coarse alignment is now less expensive.

o	Modify scale function so that the borders aren't 
	corrupted (too badly).

0.1.0

o	Add support for correction of rotation about the lens axis.

o	Add an optional match criterion for merging.

o	Add an option to adjust minimum step-size.

o	Add flags to specify which channels to use for alignment.  Use
	a summation of all channels by default.

o	Add an option to modify the error metric exponent, and change
	the default value from 1 to 2. 

o	Display information about how well a new image matches
	the accumulated image.

o	Add a rule for ale.exe to the Makefile.  

0.0.0
	Initial release.
